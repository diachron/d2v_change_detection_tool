# d2v_change_detection_tool
D2V is a flexible and powerful tool for defining, representing and detecting custom changes between datasets versions. We treat changes as first-class citizens, in a way that supports different modes of navigation on the deltas between any pair of versions, as well as the visualization of the evolution history of a given dataset.
